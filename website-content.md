## Homepage intro
Welcome to Early learning language and literacy milestone, a space designed to help families understand and support their child’s language development.

Speaking and listening are at the heart of every child’s learning. Through everyday talk, stories, songs, and play, children build the communication skills they need for thinking, connecting with others, and expressing their ideas.

Together, we can nurture confident communicators and joyful learners.

## About Language Development
From a baby’s first cry to a preschooler’s stories, language grows through interaction. Children learn to communicate by listening to others, imitating sounds, and experimenting with words.

### Stages of Development
- Birth–12 months: Babies listen to voices, respond to tone, and start to babble.
- 1–2 years: First words appear; children begin combining words like “more milk.”
- 2–3 years: Vocabulary grows quickly; sentences become longer and clearer.
- 3–5 years: Children use language to ask questions, share stories, and make friends.

These milestones vary for every child — some speak earlier, others later. What matters most is having rich, responsive interactions with caring adults.

### Theories Behind Language Learning
- Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory – learning through social interaction.
- Bruner’s scaffolding theory – adults support and expand children’s talk.
- Halliday’s functional theory – children use language for real purposes.

### Key Domains of Speaking and Listening
- Listening & attention: Noticing sounds, following routines, and focusing during play and stories.
- Phonology: Playing with sounds, rhymes, and syllables builds sound awareness for reading.
- Vocabulary (semantics): Learning new words through books, daily talk, and experiences.
- Grammar (syntax): Building longer sentences and using word endings (e.g., -ed, -s).
- Pragmatics: Using language for different purposes—requesting, explaining, joking, greeting.
- Discourse/Storytelling: Sequencing ideas, telling stories with a beginning, middle, and end.

## Why Speaking and Listening Matter
Speaking and listening shape how children learn, build relationships, and understand the world.

- Building thinking and learning: When children talk about their play or explain their ideas, they practise reasoning and imagination.
- Social and emotional development: Through conversations, children learn to take turns, show empathy, and connect with others.
- Preparing for literacy: Listening to sounds, rhymes, and stories builds early literacy foundations.

The Adult’s Role: Simple, everyday interactions — chatting during meals, describing what you see, or naming feelings — all grow language. When adults listen carefully and respond with warmth, children feel confident to share more.

## Supporting Language at Home
1. Talk Together Every Day:
   - Describe what you’re doing.
   - Ask open-ended questions.
   - Wait for your child to respond.
2. Read, Sing, and Tell Stories:
   - Read picture books daily.
   - Sing rhymes and songs.
   - Talk about what you see in pictures.
3. Play and Imagine:
   - Encourage pretend play and join in.
   - Extend your child’s ideas with new words.
4. Listen and Respond:
   - Show interest in what your child says.
   - Expand their talk naturally.
5. Use Your Home Language:
   - Keep using your strongest language — it supports English learning and builds identity.

### Characteristics of effective home-learning environments
- Warm, responsive conversations where adults listen and build on children’s ideas.
- Daily shared reading and storytelling with talk about pictures and ideas.
- Play-rich spaces with open-ended materials that invite talk and imagination.
- Routines that include language—songs at tidy-up, chatting while cooking, naming feelings.
- Opportunities to use and celebrate home languages alongside English.

## Valuing Cultural and Linguistic Diversity
Language is part of identity. Respecting children’s home languages shows that every voice matters.

### Bilingual and Multilingual Families
Children who grow up hearing more than one language have amazing opportunities. They learn to think flexibly, connect with diverse communities, and value their heritage.

### Inclusive Practices
Families and educators can ensure all cultures are represented in books, songs, and displays. Using home languages in greetings and stories helps children feel proud of who they are.
